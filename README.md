# Crispy Dollop

### The Problem
The problem I faced in this challenge was arranging the numbers containing various digits combinations (like: 7389608)

### Solution
In my approach to solve the problem, I tried to solve the problem beginning with small numbers with few digits (like: 38, 25). Then gradually, I was increasing the digits and adding more complexity to the number, to finally come with the best algorithm for any number.

In my code, I tried to break down the algorithm/process into small steps, as well as adding few comments to explain the step. Thus making the code clear and easy to maintain.

### The Problem
The main problem I encountered in this challenge is how to transform the visual solution to the problem (like: travelling clockwise in a 2D array), into an equally written code solution.

### Solution
By using JavaScript in this challenge, the solution became a little bit easier. And that is done by using array methods to remove the desired elements from the original array and insert them into the resulted array. By implementing this approach, I lefted out the pardon of paying attention to the already sorted elements (by removing them), and focus only on the current intended elements in each step.

And as I mentioned before, I used array methods in JavaScript to get the best algorithm, thus making the code super simple and understandable.
